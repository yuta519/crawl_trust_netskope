# Crawler Trust Netskope

## Why I created
- Netskope is a cloud security vendor.
- Need to supply service in 24/365.
- If something wrong happend in Netskope, our work also stops.
- So I need to monitor cloud status in Netskope.
- Netskope has a [website](https://trust.netskope.com), but they don't have notification features.
- So I did.

## Using stacks
- Python 3.9+
- Selenium 4.1.3
- chrome / chronium 99.0
